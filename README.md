## Task
The overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy 
usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is 
to reconstruct four plots, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

First the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1
needs to be forked and cloned.

For each plot one should:
+ Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
 +Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
+ Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file.
+ Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

The git repository needs to be pushed to GitHub so that the GitHub version is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.



In order to respond to the task of Week 1 Exploratory Data Analysis,
several R documents have been written.

## GetData.R
This document downloads the data and stors them in the working directory.

## Plot1.R
This script loads the data, creats a subset and saves the histogram as plot1.png.

## Plot2.R
This script loads the data, creats a subset, converts the date and time
variables into a date format and saves the plot as plot2.png.

## Plot3.R
This script loads the data, creats a subset, converts the date and time
variables into a date format and saves the plot as plot3.png.

## Plot4.R
This script loads the data, creats a subset, converts the date and time
variables into a date format and saves the plot as plot4.png.
The plot is built up from four separate plots.
